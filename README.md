# marinebon_wordpress_website
This repo is for documentation and issue tracking as related to the main marinebon.org website as implemented using wordpress in 2022.

# NOTES:
## Main Menu Editing
The menu items are hard coded in file and WP admin section will not work for the menu. We have hard coded in file because the drop-down menu design is custom made and even if we allow it to update through the wp-admin section it will need little extra update and adjustment. A single misconfiguration while updating menu will mess up the whole menu and admin access and it can't be reverted immediately unless we fix it manually.

Hereâ€™s where you edit the menu manually (need to be logged in to admin): https://marinebon.org/wp-admin/theme-editor.php?file=theme-parts%2Fheader%2Fheader-menu.php&theme=labtechco
